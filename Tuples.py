# Now you will use tuples on the same set of weights of a four-membered family having weights of 70, 80, 45,
# and 50 kg respectively, and perform some operations on it to calculate the mean of the weights.
#
# Instructions
# Suddenly you realize that you have wrongly entered 45 and that it should be 48.
# Could that be done after storing the given weights inside a tuple?
# Since it cannot be done, create a tuple with the correct weights.
# Name this new tuple weights_new and perform the following operations on it.
# Calculate the maximum and minimum weights using the max() and min() functions respectively on the new weights_new tuple.
# Save them to the maximum and minimum variables.
# Now calculate the sum of the weights using the sum() function and save it to sum_weights.
# Save the mean of their weights (using the formula sum / number of elements) to a mean_new variable.
# Test Cases: The value of maximum should be 80.
# The value of minimum should be 48.
# The calculated value of sum_weights should be 248.
# The calculated value of mean_new should be 62.0.
